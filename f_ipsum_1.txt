If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. Think about all the fucking possibilities.
