Intuition is fucking important. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Think about all the fucking possibilities. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Fuck. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display.

You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. Must-do is a good fucking master. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother?
